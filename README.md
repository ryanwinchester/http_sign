# HTTPSign

HTTP Signature Verification

Currently in development and as of v0.1.1 only supports the `verify` method, and only `RSA`.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `http_sign` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:http_sign, "~> 0.1.1"}
  ]
end
```
